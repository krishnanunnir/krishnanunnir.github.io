TLDR: Readme, Demo, Good Code, Plug

I am someone in the process of trying to improve my Github profile. I have seen a lot of awesome GitHub projects, which has helped me identify what is the difference between a good and great project. I hope to pass some of my insights onto you guys. To highlight these concepts I have attached my own projects where I have attempted to implement the explained concept
## Readme  

Starting with the most important, a lot of projects don’t have a good Readme, this is the number one issue that I see with Github projects. Readme is a good way to explain what your project does, it shows your ability to document things and to explain ideas in a succinct way. These are qualities an interviewer is looking for and would go a long way in forming a better impression of you. Furthermore, it would help people looking at your code to better understand your project. By skipping on the readme you are tossing away a great tool in your toolbox. Use your Readme to explain what problem you are trying to solve, how to set up your project and so on. Make sure you do not have any obvious spelling errors in your Readme. Eg:
[Django CMS](https://github.com/krishnanunnir/django-knode-cms)

## Demo
Have a live demo for your website or tool if it is hostable if not have a gif in your Readme. This is important since a recruiter or an interviewer looking at your project is never gonna deep dive into your project code, they will probably try to gauge what concepts you have implemented, a demo helps a long way with this. It also demonstrates you know how to push websites to production. I have used Heroku to host some of my projects mainly because of the ease of pushing to production, I have seen some people use netlify. Choose any of these platforms and host your project. Make sure your hosted website domain is clean and easily visible in your repo.
Eg:
[First Contrib](https://github.com/krishnanunnir/opensource-first-contrib-search), 
[Remote Machine Monitor](https://github.com/krishnanunnir/Remote-Machine-Monitor)

## Code
Pay attention to details, having a.DS_Store in your repository will look very amateurish, this can be easily avoided by adding a .gitignore. Make sure your project has a clear folder structure, maybe an src folder for your main code or something similar, look at other open-source projects for inspiration. Something else good projects have in common is that they follow a commit philosophy, I have seen a lot of people make commits that wouldn’t make any sense if they were to look at it a few days later, don’t make this mistake, coding is a collaborative process, you are not writing the commit for yourself, you are writing it for your teammates, keep this in mind while you are writing commits. I personally try to follow the Angular commit style which I think is a very clean way to present your commits. Add a license, it is a good way to look more authentic. Eg: [Django CMS](https://github.com/krishnanunnir/django-knode-cms)

## Profile

Ensure your profile has a professional username, this I learned the hard way because I thought it would be funny to have 420 in my profile name. There is no way that comes out looking good. Also in the domain of naming, make sure your project has an easily searchable name, as it would be otherwise very difficult for people to discover your project. 

## Blog 
If you are working on concepts or ideas that do not have a lot of resources online, any information you have gathered, make sure you take notes and consolidate into a blog. This is a
a good way to give visibility to your projects and ideas and also in the process helps a lot of people.

## Most important step of them all.
Plug yourself!

I know Reddit/Internet is big on being modest and all forms of promotion are seen as bad but build things that are useful, you can show it to people and people will appreciate it. At the end of the day number of stars and the number of forks count, it means you have made something meaningful, that has made an impact on the people around you. It is an extremely gratifying feeling that drives me a lot.

A good way to plug is to have a personal blog or post about your projects to Reddit ;). Hence this article. 

Hoping to write more of these based on your review.
