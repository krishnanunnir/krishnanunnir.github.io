title: Using Vim as a file explorer
---

I recently found out vim can be used to go around folders, and operations like rename, delete and sort are also supported. Vim is intimidating, especially when you start using it for large projects, I think this feature could bridge the gap a bit.This feature is also pretty easy to use.

``` vim <folder-name> ```  


Yes! that is it.
