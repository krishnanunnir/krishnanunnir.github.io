I am currently working as a Member of Technical Staff for Zoho Corporation. I realised my love for web applications when I was introduced to Django in my first year of college. My love for creating solutions have only grown with introductions to newer technologies, which I have learned over the last few years.

At college breaks, I have interned in professional environments and also in startups giving me insight into creating sustainable and scalable web applications. I also have a good grasp over UI design and can hold myself in building full-stack web applications. I have used PHP along with its framework, Codeigniter and libraries to implement an image processing facilities for a startup I was working for. I have also developed an application for use for Colleges for taking tests. The advantage it offers is its ability to take tests remotely and allows teachers to instantly calculate scores, making a test taking a less tedious process for students and teachers.

Recently, I have taken an interest in learning more about Decentralized Web Applications and the Ethereum environment. I have created an Ethereum based Package Logistic Management DAPP for prevention of fraudulent activities involved in the transfer of packages.
